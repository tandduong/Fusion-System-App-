# Fusion-System-App-
Create Java GUI for Fusion System Project


This is a group project for building a database app for Fusion System using SWING for GUI and Netbeans as an IDE. This app allows users to login/logout, edit/update, search/delete the data while interacting. 

I did the GUI design, programed the action, and connected those Java files to the database and EERD, as well as tested all the SQL queries.  

Find more information about the system on reports manuals.

To see how to run this app and snippet source code, see "Software Report"

To see how to use this app, see tutorial manuals.
